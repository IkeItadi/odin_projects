        I have been making this recipe for over 20 years. This can be served over
        either rice or noodles. A little work but worth the effort.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 ounces butter</li>
        <li>4 green onions, sliced (white parts only)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed beef broth</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon prepared mustard</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white wine</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Remove any fat and gristle from the roast and cut into strips 1/2 inch
            thick by 2 inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon of both salt and
            pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and brown the beef
            strips quickly, then push the beef strips off to one side. Add the
            onions and cook slowly for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with
            the beef strips.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir the flour into the juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in
            beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the heat and
            stir in mustard. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until the meat is
            tender.
        </li>
        Five minutes before serving, stir in the mushrooms, sour cream, and white
        wine. Heat briefly then salt and pepper to taste.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can fat-free condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Saute ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and
            crumbly; 5 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            At the same time, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring
            to a rapid boil. Cook egg noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the
            bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain and discard any fat from the cooked beef. Stir condensed soup and
            garlic powder into the beef. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring
            occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove beef from the heat. Add egg noodles and stir to combine. Stir in
            sour cream and season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
    </ol>
